Some minor changes on top of [jacintosuner/wilor](https://github.com/jacintosuner/wilor)

- `demo_rpad_foxglove.py` runs WiLoR and scales it according to input depth using GSAM

# Scaling for better 3D Alignment

</div>

## What we do
Outputs of WiLoR:
- 3D hand and its 2D projection onto the image. <br>
What we infer:
- we modify (or "scale") the coordinates of the 3D hand so they align (in 3D) with the real 3D hand. We leverage their alignment in the image. <br>

Pseudocode: <br>
1) Identify which of the 3D wilor hand points are visible from the camera point of view.
2) Average their depth (obtaining avg_3d_wilor_hand)
3) Identify which of the pixels in the image correspond to these 3D wilor hand points
    3.1) Project the 3D wilor hand points onto the image
    3.2) Create a mask from the projection
4) Average the depth of the pixels from step 3, obtaining avg_3d_real_hand.
    4.1) Note: we don’t consider the real point clouds that are further away than 1.6m (distance to the end of the experiments table in this case)
6) Compute the ratio of both averages: depth_ratio = avg_3d_real_hand / avg_3d_wilor_hand.
7) Scale the 3D wilor hand points using the depth_ratio
    6.1) Save their depths into an array old_depths
    6.1) Project the 3D wilor hand points onto the image
    6.2) Turn those projected points back to 3D considering their new depths = old_depths * depth_ratio, and considering the real camera intrinsics.

## Further improvements using GSAM2 segmentation
In step 3.2), the WiLoR hand 2D projection might match pixels that do not match with the real hand but with an object (i.e. when the real hand is occluded by that object). That would mean in steps 3.2) and 4) we include the depths of the object rather than the ones from the real hand, making the scaling a bit inaccurate. We solve this issue using a hand segmentation from GSAM2.
This improvement is set by default.

Here's an example taken from the file "demo_rgbk/mug_lots_of_occlusion.npy":

## Our installation (Cuda 12.1 / 12.4)
```bash
conda create --name wilor python=3.10
conda activate wilor
conda install pytorch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.19.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install GSAM2 within the same conda environment as WiLoR.
Additional requirements for GSAM2 and visualizations:
```bash
pip install -r third_party/Grounded-SAM-2/grounding-dino/requirements.txt
# Additional requirements from the fork
pip install open3d
pip install pyk4a
```


## Running it
```bash
python demo_rgbdk.py --npy_folder demo_rgbdk --out_folder demo_out --save_mesh
python demo_rgbdk.py --npy_folder demo_rgbdk --out_folder demo_out --save_mesh --no_gsam2
```

## Visualizations
Python scripts have been added to the folder [utils](https://github.com/jacintosuner/WiLoR/tree/main/utils) to:
- capture an rbgdk frame (rgb + depth + camera intrinsics): [capture_rgbdk.py](https://github.com/jacintosuner/WiLoR/blob/main/utils/capture_rgbdk.py)
- visualize an rgbdk frame together with / or an obj file together with / or a pcd file (npy file with point cloud info): [visualize_rgbdk_or_obj_or_pcd.py ](https://github.com/jacintosuner/WiLoR/blob/main/utils/visualize_rgbdk_or_obj_or_pcd.py)

## Further comments:
I'm not sure if the MANO model also considers the size of the hand. That means that if we scale the hand, it might not correspond anymore to a MANO model hand.
